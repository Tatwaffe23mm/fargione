{"name":"Fargione","tagline":"Chance and the deterministic concentration of wealth - there is no escape! Really?","body":"### Chance an the deterministic concentration of wealth\r\nJoseph E. Fargione showed in 2011, how one can explain easily the distribution of wealth as intrinsic feature of our system. http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0020728\r\nImpressed by the mathematical simplicity and the relevancy to everyday life I want to build an interactive website, bringing the implications of J.E. Fargione his findings to life. And more important, I want to show, that the distribution of wealth is determined by the frame, the society is giving for the markets. It is possible to manage the distribution of wealth over the society. Thus it is a question to the society, how much inequality it accepts or not. There is NO \"god given\" dirstribution of wealth. Everything can be managed - by us!\r\n\r\n### How can you help?\r\nSince I am not a pro developer, I am seeking for help to bring my ideas to interactive life. A good piece of work is already done. The simulation is coded in javascript and properly running. A basic set of graphs is created also. Now, everything has to be put into an interactive, explorable and didactic interesting website. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAndré Carls (@tatwaffe23mm), inspired by Joseph E. Fargione's work in his paper http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0020728. I am not a professional developer, so I beg for pardon for my probably bad coding style. I am aware of it and I try to improve it gradually through the stages of the project. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
